Glossary Guidelines
========

Glossaries in DemocracyOS will be a markdown file.

Markdown is the language we use to syle text. <br><br>
[Here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) you'll find some basic information on how it works and [here](http://dillinger.io/) a useful link where you can practice markdown.

####Example
If you want to link **this** to the glossary this is how you do it:

```
Link <a href="/help/glossary?word=this">this</a> to the glossary.
```

####Alert
Do not use accents or symbols and always separate words by a dash (-)
